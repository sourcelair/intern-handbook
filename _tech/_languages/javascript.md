# JavaScript at SourceLair

We use JavaScript extensively at SourceLair to build the client-side applications that run in our customers' browsers. For example, https://www.sourcelair.com consists of **tens of thousands of lines of JavaScript code that run in a browser**.

## Getting Started

A great place to get started with JavaScript is Codecademy's **Learn JavaScript** course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript.

## Documentation

All the JavaScript documentation you will need is available at the Mozilla Developer Network website:

- **Generic JavaScript documentation**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
- **Browser JavaScript documentation**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/API

## Books

An excellent book to read about JavaScript is **Eloquent JavaScript** by Marijn Haverbeke and it's available for free at https://eloquentjavascript.net/.
