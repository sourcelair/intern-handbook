# New features and bug fixes

At SourceLair we follow the GitHub Flow to develop our software and release regularly. You can read more about the GitHub flow and also see it visualised at https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/.

Below we provide you with the required steps for starting work on a new feature or bug fix in your project.

## Steps

1. **Save your current changes** (if any). You can either [commit them](https://help.sourcelair.com/git/committing-your-files/) or [stash them](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash).
2. **[Checkout](https://help.sourcelair.com/git/checking-out-a-branch/) the `master` branch locally**.
3. **[Pull from the `upstream` remote](https://help.sourcelair.com/git/pulling-from-a-remote/)** to synchronise your local `master` branch with `upstream`.
4. **[Push to the `origin` remote](https://help.sourcelair.com/git/pushing-to-a-remote/)** to synchronise your personal fork with `upstream`.
5. **[Create a new branch](https://help.sourcelair.com/git/creating-a-branch/)** for your upcoming work.
6. **Write and commit your code**.
7. **Open a new [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) in GitHub**
